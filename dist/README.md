# Assignment: Build Etsy Search Page using Ajax

### Special things needed
1. etsy requires your ajax request settings to have the `dataType: jsonp`
2. surge url to use https://jcsjtiyday16etsysearch.surge.sh/
3. Etsy API


## Issues
1. Tried to get the search bar functionality going but wasn't able to get the whole thing to rerun on return key keyup. I tried wrapping it all in a function that I'd call on return keyup, but it didn't render anything. So, I'll have to ask Jess tomorrow how to get that kind of thing to work.
